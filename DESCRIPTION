Description: Weighted Sliced Inverse Regression (WSIR) is a supervised dimension 
    reduction algorithm for spatial transcriptomics gene expression data. For a 
    provided gene expression matrix and dataframe of each cell's spatial 
    coordinates, WSIR creates a low-dimensional representation of the gene 
    expression data that preserves the ability to predict spatial coordinates 
    that was present in the gene expression data. Furthermore, WSIR provides 
    interpretable loadings which allow for projection of new single-cell gene 
    expression data into a low-dimensional space which preserves the spatial 
    information present in the gene expression data.

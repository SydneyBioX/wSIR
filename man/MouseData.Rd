\description{
Data set consists of spatial transcriptomics data from a mouse embryo.
There are three samples, for each we have gene expression data (351 genes), spatial
coordinates on the two-dimensional spatial plane, and cell type labels.
Sample 1 contains 19451 cells, sample 2 contains 14891 cells and sample 3
contains 23194 cells. We have randomly sampled 20\% of the cells from
each of these datasets for the vignette and examples to stop the data being
too large. After the random sampling, we have 3848 cells in sample 1, 2986
cells in sample 2 and 4607 cells in sample 3.
